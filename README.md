## Inspiration
There are people in this world who want to tell stories without revealing their identities. This application was built to help resolve that problem. 
## What it does
Anyone can submit stories anonymously. And others can read those stories. No one will be able to edit, delete the stories submitted by others. There is no react or comment feature because then the new users will start having biased opinions. This allows users to think original thoughts and make heir own opinions. 
## How I built it
Styling was done using CSS.
Scripting was done using JavaScript.
In this application anyone can post data from the HTML form to MongoDB Atlas. Then using EJS we display that data from the MongoDB Atlas to an HTML table.
## Challenges I ran into
I was having trouble deciding an method to display the data, we chose to use EJS. 
I was also having trouble deciding if creating this application would be ethical, we decided that everyone deserves an unbiased opportunity to tell their stories.
## Accomplishments that I am proud of
This application gained positive response from the users.
## What I learned
Learnt to use MongoDB Atlas, Express js, body-parser, mongoose, Node, CSS Styling, EJS.
In this platform each individual has equal importance, so sometimes people who are the most quiet can speak the loudest words but aren't able to. We learnt that using this application we can give them equal opportunities to speak.
## What's next for Anonymous secret sharing service
Based on user response on the application, this can be upgraded to add new features like adding tags so users  can see data based on shortlisting done by the tags. or when the database grows way bigger, we will have a limitations to the display function. Like only the last 20 submissions will be displayed.
